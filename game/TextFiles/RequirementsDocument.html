Requirements Specification
</h3>


<h4>intro:</h4>
<p1>Our project will consist of four high score based mini games based on the old Game and Watch games.  We will be remaking the games using our own programming and designing abilities.  We will be attempting to recreate the games Fire, Oil, Flagman and Helmet.
</p1>

<h4>Functional Requirements:</h4>
<p1>The player will have the option to choose which game to play as well as the ability to look at previous high scores for each game.  The games are designed so that the longer the player “lives” the more difficult the games become and the pace becomes faster.  After the player “dies”, they will be prompted to enter initials so that their high score can be saved, provided they beat one of the previous high scores. 
</p1>

<h5>Fire</h5>
<p1>Control the medics with the left and right arrow keys to catch the falling man! If you drop him 3 times you lose!
</p1>

<h5>Oil</h5>
<p1>Catch the oil drops in the bucket by using the left and right arrow keys! Dump the oil out the window with the space bar on either side of the building when the man with the oil tank is standing underneath the window. Your bucket can only hold 3 drops, you overflow it, miss an oil drop, or throw the oil on the ground you gain a miss. Three misses is game over.</p1>

<h5>Flagman</h5>
<p1>Match the numbers displayed before the time runs out by using the number keys. Three Misses ends the game.</p1>

<h5>Helmet</h5>
<p1>Use the arrow keys to run through the door when its open! Its raining hard objects, get hit three times and you lose.</p1>

<h4>Non-Functional Requirements:</h4>
<p1>We will be using Adobe Photoshop to create the graphics/logos for the project.  The programming will be done in Java version 6 using the Eclipse environment.  The games will have the ability to run on Ubuntu Linux, Windows 7, and Mac OSX.  The minimum resolution for the game is 800 x 600.  The exact amount of RAM and memory needed is unknown, though we won’t need a large amount of either to run the game.  The deadline for the project is June 6th, 2013.
</p1>

<h4>System Evolution:</h4>
<p1>Time constraint played a big role in this game! After the general game template was completed, adding new games takes only a few days. If we had 1-2 more weeks we would have added sound into the games, and had 4 additional, more complicated games. All of the games are designed off a system of abstract classes called Game, Player, Sprite. Individual games implement these classes.
